    * Modified keys for open/close and magic: 
        * 'o'pen (instead of 'O')
        * 'c'lose (instead of 'C')
        * 'm'agic (instead of 'c'ast)
    * Add fast movement command that uses the following (direction) input 
      for running (g).
    * Implement a long-rest command: (w)ait which will ignore adjacent 
      floating eyes und umber hulks.
    * Added functionality to (r)ead/(q)uaff/(e)quip/(t)ake off/(d)rop an 
      item quickly.
    * Remember visited landmarks. A list of these can be shown with (D).
    * Rearranged hp/mp/xp display to be more consistent with other stats.
    * Display carried item weight in inventory header. Removed the command 
      previously used to display the pack weight.
    * Display the bank account balance in shop windows.
    * Added item description popup to inventory.
    * Allow equipping items in the trade post.
    * The message history is shown reversed and the entries are prefixed 
      with their turn number. Truncate the message log to 100 entries.
    * Enhanced the dialogue to get a number: set overwrite mode as 
      default; accept 'y', 'g', 'd' and 'p' as the full amount and 'n' as 0 
      to speed up getting and dropping multiple items. 
    * Ask for the player's name and sex during game creation if not set in 
      .ini file or by command line parameters.
    * Prompt if a fireball is going to hit the player.
    * When autopicking up stuff, give a message if there are more items 
      there.

      allow the initial letters of the button captions as shortcut.
    * Mention command help ('?' command) at game start/reload.

      things out.
    * Open doors by walking into them, though not on shift-run.
    * Modified some monster glyphs. 
    * Make the potion of cure dianthroritis expensive. This is a simple 
      flavour change: If you attempt to sell this unique potion, you should 
      get more money for it than for a corroded dagger. Remove the potion 
      from the player's inventory when winning the game.
    * When magic mapping, only map non-floor tiles.
    * Sometimes flip custom maze maps when generating levels. Should keep

      it.

      remove curse and spell extension less powerful and added a blessed 
      variant with the original power. Let the player decide which gem to make
      perfect, wich item to identify or to uncurse when using the uncursed 
      variant.

      volcano level, the unique items _amulet of larn_ and _potion of cure 
      dianthroritis_ will be regenerated. Never ever destroy the potion of 
      cure dianthroritis by erosion.
    * Vampires would never use their bite attack. Now there is a 20% 
      chance that they will do so. 
    * The ziller and vortex can now attack again.
    * Store monster AI state in saved games.
    * Prevent uninjured monsters being displayed as "slightly injured".
    * Honour time usage when doing auto-pickup. Call autopickup when 
      entering a new level. 
    * Disallow opening/closing doors while paralysed or overstrained. 
    * Fixed the calculation of bank account interest when doing a time 
      warp.
