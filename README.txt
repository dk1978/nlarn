	Welcome to NLarn!

The goal of the game is to find the potion to cure your daughter from the 
illness "diantrorithis" and bring it back home. Time is finite - when you
return to your home, the doctor will tell you how much time is left.  

The game consists of a home town, and two dungeons: the caverns of Larn and 
the volcano. The potion is hidden inside the volcano, which is unfortunately 
populated by dragons and demons. To be able to fight the latter, you have to 
gain experience and wealth by fighting through the caverns. The equipment 
available in the town shops is expensive, but will help you to survive in 
the volcano long enough to find the potion. 

The entrance of the caverns is depicted by the letter 'O'; the shaft leading 
down to the volcano by the letter 'I'.

You can get help inside the game by pressing '?' or 'F1'.
