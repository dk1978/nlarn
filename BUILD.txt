Building nlarn

nlarn is known to work on Linux, FreeBSD and Windows. 

** Dependencies

You will need glib 2 and a curses library (ncurses and PDCurses are known 
to work). To generate a makefile you need premake4. Get it at 

	http://industriousone.com/premake

On Windows nlarn builds using MinGW. Just install PDCurses, glib, pkg-config 
and premake4 into the MinGW folders and premake4 should be able to generate 
a Makefile.

** Building

Generate a Makefile with premake4:

	premake4 gmake

If you have installed all the dependencies, calling make (or gmake on FreeBSD)
should build nlarn.
